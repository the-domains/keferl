Naka-meguro: Area overview

****

The Naka-meguro area, in Meguro, Tokyo is situated around Naka-meguro station which opened in 1927\. "Meguro" means "black eyes", and is derived from Meguro Fudō, one of five Fudō-myōō statues that were placed on the border of Edo in the seventeenth century. The statues were thought to provide protection to the area and each statue had different coloured eyes. Naka-meguro today is a fashionable area of Tokyo, offering quaint boutiques, trendy cafes and plenty of quiet spots to relax and absorb the pleasant atmosphere of the neighbourhood. However, the area differs greatly from the atmosphere of slick Omotesando, where iconic designer labels rule and international flagships are a dime a dozen. Naka-meguro has a much quieter elegance, and locals are likely to prefer books on DIY and hidden boutiques featuring emerging Japanese and Scandinavian labels. It's hipper and has a touch more soul than many of the other fashion hubs of Tokyo, making it an eclectic attraction for many travellers. If you're in the mood to explore a quieter side to Tokyo, Nakameguro is a good place to start.

Meguro River

****

The key landmark of Naka-meguro is Meguro-gawa, a quiet street that runs either side of the Meguro River. Cherry blossoms line the river, their long branches dangling artfully over the high walls either side of the water. During May, Naka-meguro is one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the stunning blooms, with tourists and locals vying for covetable vantage spots at riverside cafes and restaurants. A wander down Meguro-gawa and along the smaller streets adjacent to the river, will provide many interesting boutiques and cafes to explore.

Opening in 2013 Meguro Sky Tower is a lush rooftop oasis that sits 15-35 metres above street level. The motorway below is a busy one, however, the space is cleverly designed so that not a car can be heard from the garden above. Take a seat and enjoy some summer sun in the warmer months, and admire the plum and cherry blossoms in winter and spring. On clear days you can also catch a glimpse of Mt Fuji from the garden's observatory deck, which boasts views all the way to Akamatsu. To access the garden, follow the street signs from Ikejiri-Ohashi station, which will lead you to an inconspicuous elevator next to the JP post office that will take you up to the rooftop.

Sugekari Park

****

Tucked away in a small suburban street is an urban oasis with a little something for everyone. Sugekari Park is a quiet reserve frequented mostly by locals and children from the nearby elementary school. There's a kid's play area where little ones can run around on the grass, and for adults, a manicured Japanese garden and traditional Japanese house that overlook a large pond complete with koi fish. This is a great pitt stop if you decide to walk through Naka-meguro and on to Shibuya (about a 15 minute walk from Sugekari park).
